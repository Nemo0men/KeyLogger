# KeyLogger
Intro to Cyber Programming Assignment #1

## Description
You will be writing your own keystroke logger.  You can use any programming language you choose.  The TAs and I have used Python.  Your requirements are:

1.  Your program must write the keystrokes to a file.

2.  Your program must timestamp each keypress.

3.  Your code must be commented.

Please submit a copy of your code and a screenshot of it working as a PDF file.  Then submit your source code (.py, .java, etc.) as a second file.  Your screenshot should be similar to the one provided below and it should show some keystrokes logged.
